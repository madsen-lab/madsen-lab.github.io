Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am working on the Islet Cartography project in the MadLab group.\nThe Islet Cartography project aims at drawing high confidence and robust maps of the transcriptome, epigenome and electrophysical state of cell types and subtypes in islets of Langerhans from type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics. My focus of the project is on identifying an optimal end-to-end pipeline for integration in scRNA-seq for creating the maps of the transcriptome and electrophysiological properties, which I will then use for computational deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq. My motivation comes from the great significance this project holds in deepening our understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, facilitating discovery of new putative targets for drug development, as well as paving the way for generating deep atlases in other biological contexts."

We aim to address some of the major analytical challenges faced in the single-cell transcriptomics by developing the data adaptive approaches to identify low quality cells, as well as using the mathematical models to identify apoptotic cells."

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark, where I am the principal investigator in MadLab.\nMy training in molecular biology has given me a ‘sense for biology’ and a comprehesive understanding of the biases and possibilities of experimental techniques. This, combined with a flair for statistical programming, gives me a strong foundation for navigating the space between biology, computer science and mathematics in a manner that produces tangible scientific progress.\nI believe that future scientific breakthrough can be made through collaborative, interdisciplinary, creativity and open science. For that reason, we strive to be involved in international research centers, where researchers with different competences collaborate. We thrive to enroll students with different backgrounds ranging from physics to medicine, and we active work towards a working culture that focuses on creativity, ideas and progress rather than long working hours and strict deliverables."

Currently, I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark working on the Islet Cartography project in MadLab.\nThe Islet Cartography project is aiming to provide a multi-layered map of the islets of Langerhans combining the transcriptome, epigenome, and electrophysical state of the cell types in the islets. My focus in the project is the epigenome layer, studying the imputation and integration of single-cell ATAC-seq data as well as deconvoluting bulk ATAC-seq data.

    "text": "Human Gene Regulatory Map\nMadLab is a partner in the Human Gene Regulation Map (HGRM), a part of the new Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease (NNFC). The aim of HGRM is to build comprehensive maps of gene regulation in the human genome as a resource for uncovering biological mechanisms on common genetic diseases, with an initial focus on cell types relevant to cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes. We aim to combine recent advances in genomics, molecular biology, single-cell analysis, and stem cell models with approaches in computational biology and machine learning to identify fundamental rules of gene regulation.\n\n\nATLAS\nMabLab is a partner in the Center for Functional Genomics and Tissue Plasticity (ATLAS). The aim of ATLAS is to obtain systems-level, mechanistic and cell type-resolved understanding of adipose and hepatic tissue plasticity in response to diet-induced obesity and regression in mouse models; and to translate this for in-depth understanding of the functional changes in human adipose and hepatic tissues in response to severe obesity and reversal. The center applies a combination of functional genomics approaches, mouse models, proteomics, in vivo targeting, computational biology, and clinical studies."
